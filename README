libsox.sh
---------

A library for GNU bash making it easier to create music with the power of SoX
synths.

Usage
-----

Simply source libsox.sh into the script containing the music. Example scripts
are included in this repository.

Example child script syntax
---------------------------

./music.sh | xargs play -S -V1 # Plays into SoX once

./music.sh | xargs ./myplay-repeat.sh 1 # Plays into SoX twice

./music.sh | xargs ./mysox.sh music.wav # Saves into "music.wav" using SoX

./music.sh | head -n +37 | xargs play -S -V1 ; ./music.sh | tail -n +37 |
 xargs ./myplay-repeat.sh 3    # Plays line 1 to 37 of music.sh's output once,
                                 then plays the rest thrice

./music.sh | xargs ./mysox.sh - | cvlc - # Saves into stdout then pipes it into
                                           vlc
./music.sh > music.txt         # Redirects music.sh's output to a text file

./music.sh | xclip -i          # Copies music.sh's output to XA_PRIMARY
